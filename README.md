# Unity-Doom
Getting gameplay running alongside DoomLoader

Project aimed at getting an easy integration of Doom into any system out there.

We are building this on top of DoomLoader: https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/98682-doomloader-for-unity/

Hopefully this project can eventually be used as a base to build all sorts of integrations of Doon in Unity games
