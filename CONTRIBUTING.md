The main goal of this project is to simply create a shell that can load Doom Wads
and play them as if they were loaded into Doom itself.

We have no assets pulled directly into the project (unless they're clearly placeholders)

- everything should be pulled from the wads -

I also want to keep this as a lightweight game for easy integration into any system.
Let's keep the entire game within the one scene and keep it modular so folk can easily
add new content on their projects.

Put nothing fancy in this project, just simple vanilla Doom.
